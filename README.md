Advanced ML Final Project

My final project group, consisting of myself (Ben Annicelli), Daniel Sanguino, and Ben Blechman, will be working on a model that will recognize if there is a fish in a live video (first phase), and eventually recognize a specific species of fish (final phase). The model will be uploaded to a ground robot (no underwater robot is available). Once the onboard camera recognizes a fish in the frame (we'll likely use a picture of a fish on an iPad or something similar) the motors will be activated and the robot will follow the fish.
